# 🚦 Traffic Density Analyzer

A smart traffic management system that monitors and analyzes vehicle density in real-time using Arduino-based sensors. It dynamically adjusts traffic signals to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow in urban areas.

---

## 📌 Overview

The **Traffic Density Analyzer** enhances urban traffic control by using sensor data and embedded systems. It dynamically adapts traffic signals based on real-time vehicle flow to reduce congestion and improve transportation efficiency.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 📡 Real-time traffic monitoring with ultrasonic sensors  
- 📊 Dynamic traffic light adjustment based on density  
- 🚗 Reduced congestion and smoother traffic flow  
- 🔁 Sensor-based decision-making and automation

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Hardware**: Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)  
- **Programming**: C / C++  
- **Tools**: Arduino IDE

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Sensor Input**  
   Ultrasonic sensors detect vehicle presence and measure distance periodically.

2. **Traffic Density Calculation**  
   Arduino calculates traffic density using the distance values from sensors.

3. **Signal Adjustment**  
   Based on the density, the system adjusts the signal timing dynamically to avoid congestion.
